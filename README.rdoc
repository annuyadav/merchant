== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things to do:

* Install Elasticsearch

* Copy /config/database.yml.example to /config/database.yml

* Execute rake db:create db:migrate db:seed

* Start the app: rails s

* browse the app in browser at localhost:3000

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
